# Adversarial Faces
A repository for exploring how adversarial machine learning can provide privacy against face recognition. 

# Code Interface
* `preprocess_vggface.py` has two modes of operation:
  * both rely on the VGG Face dataset being under `image_directory` organized as `identity/image.jpg`
  * `preprocess` reads in the VGG Face-downloaded `bbox_file`, crops the images, prewhitens them, and saves them *all* under one giant `.h5` file with path `output_directory/nXXXXXX/images.h5`
  * `write_embeddings` generates embeddings from the model and the images written before and saves them under a giant `.h5` file with path `output_directory/nXXXXXX/embeddings.h5`
  * the mode of operation needs to be specified with the `--op` option
  * if a file of subsampled identities (in the format generated by `sample_identities.py`) is provided with the `--sampled_identities` option, then only those identities and images are processed
  * see `run_preprocess_subsample.sh` for an example of using this script twice to a) generate the preprocessed images and then b) compute and write the embeddings
* `run_adversarial_attacks.py` generates adversarially perturbed images and saves them under `output_directory/nXXXXXX/attack_type/epsilon_XX.h5`. The resulting file has two datasets: `embeddings` and `images`

# Attack Terminology
* `self_distance`: push embedding as far away from where it original was as possible
 * resulting images stored as `VGG_BASE/test_perturbed/nXXXXXX/self_distance/epsilon_XXX.h5`
* `target_image`: pick an image of a different subject and use its embedding as a target
 * resulting images stored as `VGG_BASE/test_perturbed/nXXXXXX/target_image/epsilon_XXX.h5`
* [DEPRECATED/ABANDONED] `random_target`: sample a vector in the output space at random to use as the target
* `community_naive_same`: modify all images not belonging to identity A so that they embed to the same, randomly sampled vector corresponding to A
 * resulting images stored as `VGG_BASE/test_perturbed_sampled/nXXXXXX/community_naive_same/nYYYYYY/epsilon_ZZZ.h5` where the `XXXXX` identity is the ground truth and the `YYYYYY` identity is the target
